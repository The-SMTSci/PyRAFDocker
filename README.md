# PyRAFDocker
Docker and docker compose for IRAF/PyRAF.

This project provides a few Dockerfiles that allow X11 applications to run within docker containers. It is intended to isolate PyRAF graphics from other OS interactions.

Currently, the main emphasis is in the Compose side.

Little more than the barest of bones are here.
